## Motivation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Explain and analyze institutional change using Amable and Palombarini's neorealist approach [@amable_leconomie_2005; @amable_neorealist_2008; @amable_multidimensional_2023]

-   Switzerland as a case study

## Why Switzerland ?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Switzerland is often ignored in the theories of political economy/comparative capitalism
-   Switzerland allows to study stability instead of crisis (France, Italy)
-   Switzerland is often considered as a very stable and efficient country

## Research question {.smaller}

> [What social basis for a neoliberal transformation of the Swiss model ?]{style="color:red;"}

Research in three parts

1.  Short history of the Swiss social blocs since 1848, based on the literature

-   Then, two empirical analyses based on two different approach to social blocs

2.  The bi-dimensional "political compass" approach
    -   Implicit definition of social blocs, which are pre-defined groups based on income and education levels [@piketty_capital_2019] or social classes [@oesch_electoral_2018]
3.  A multidimensional and bottom-up clustering approach, using latent class analysis [@amable_search_2021]

## Hypotheses {.smaller}

1.  *Brahmin left versus merchant right hypotheses*

    -   BvsM1. The support for the left and left-wing parties should be negatively associated with education and income levels in the first time periods. The negative association with education should then decrease and become positive over time.
    -   BvsM2. The support for the right and right-wing parties should be positively associated with education and income in the first time periods and the positive association with education should decrease over time.

2.  *Bourgeois bloc hypotheses*

    -   BB1. The support for redistribution and state intervention should decrease with education and income. Support for equal rights between Swiss citizen and foreigners should increase with education and income.
    -   BB2. Support for right-wing parties and the right should increase with both income and education levels.

## Latent class analysis

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   8 questions as indicators to endogenously infer clusters (socio-political groups)

-   3 step approach to explore the relationships between clusters and party support/ political leaning

-   Selects data for 1999, a turning point in Swiss politics

-   Left bloc: clusters 2 and 8 are composed by wealthy and well-educated individuals, only cluster 12 is composed by popular elements. Potential targets of the left bloc, clusters 4 and 1, are rather composed by middle/lower-middle classes.

-   Liberal conservative bloc: clusters 3 and 7 are the least wealthy and educated; 9 and 10 among the most wealthy and educated.

## Discussion of the results {.smaller}

Regression analysis:

-   Results validate brahmin left vs merchant right hypothesis more than the WPID's own results

-   A few exceptions: difference between second highest and lowest income groups for left leaning

-   Analyses of the WPID extended to abstention and policy preferences

12 clusters model for 1999:

-   Dominant liberal conservative bloc, which is nonetheless divided over European integration and some economic issues (high income taxation)

-   The predominance of anti-EU and popular groups in the liberal conservative bloc could explain the failure of a neoliberal/bourgeois bloc strategy and the slowdown of the reforms after 2003.

-   Left bloc: incentives to attract parts of cluster 1 and 4, which are more moderate

## Limits and further research

Five levels for a theoretical framework for institutional change [@amable_neorealist_2008]:

1.  Ideology

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
2.  Demands of social actors
:::

3.  Political mediation
4.  [Identification of social groups]{style="color:red;"} and of which benefit/loose from economic dynamics and public policy
5.  Institutions

## Limits and further research {.smaller}

My master's thesis is only a first step for a neorealist analysis of Switzerland's institutional change. There is still a lot to be done.

In further work, I envisage to do the following:

-   Better assess Switzerland's political stability
-   Conduct LCA for more recent periods (for instance 2019)
    -   Other periods such as 2003 or 2007 could also be interesting
-   Run a more complex and wide regression analysis
    -   Multilevel models & including 2016-2020 data
-   Take ideology more into account
-   Explore institutional and economic dynamics
-   Identification of Switzerland's demand regime from a post-Keynesian perspective
-   Better explain how social groups' interests are protected/discarded by economic dynamics and public policy
