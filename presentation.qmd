Hello and welcome to my master's thesis defense entitled "the political economy of institutional change and social blocs in Switzerland: a neorealist approach". The main motivation behind this thesis was my desire to contribute to the analysis of institutional change and to the neorealist approach to institutional change developed by Amable and Palombarini, whose work is the main source of inspiration behind this work. As the work of this approach has focused mainly on France and Italy, I have attempted to contribute by analyzing a new country: Switzerland.

## Why Switzerland ?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Switzerland is often ignored in the theories of political economy/comparative capitalism
-   Switzerland allows to study stability instead of crisis (France, Italy)
-   Switzerland is often considered as a very stable and efficient country

::: notes
I therefore chose Switzerland as a case study, which I felt would be interesting for the following reasons. Firstly, the Swiss case allows us to study stability rather than the instability that characterizes the Italian and French cases. While the neorealist approach stresses the irreducibility of social conflict and crisis, the countries vary in the way they regulate this conflict. Unlike France and Italy, Switzerland is often held up as an example of political stability and economic performance. If we make an international comparison of, for example, trust in government (zoom in on graph), Switzerland stands out remarkably from other countries when it comes to stability. The most frequently cited reasons for this performance and stability are often attributed to the country's political institutions, its liberal economy, its education system and so on.

If we look at other data, we can trace political stability in a longer perspective. The second graph shows confidence in government since 1981. It can be seen that Swiss political stability is not so obvious for all periods, and that certain periods of crisis can be suspected, the most apparent of which is the 90s.

Switzerland is therefore an interesting case to study, as it stands in stark contrast to the Italian and French cases. Switzerland is also an interesting case because of the peculiarity of its economic and political institutions, as well as the trajectory of their change.

## Switzerland and comparative capitalism

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Coordinated market economy [@hall_varieties_2001]
-   Organized capitalism [@charles_fast_2024]
-   Hybrid model [@trampusch_switzerland_2011]
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](pw/machtrampusch2011.jpg){fig-align="right" width="217"}
:::
:::

-   Insight from the neorealist approach: the stability of the Swiss socio-economic model depends of the country's social blocs, in particular the dominant social bloc.

::: notes
Switzerland is therefore also an interesting case study, given the peculiarity of its institutions, and theories of comparative capitalism have used a wide variety of terms to classify the Swiss model. In common opinion, Switzerland is regarded as a very liberal economy, but the contributions of comparative capitalism have initially classified the Swiss model among the modele rhenan (Michel Albert) model, coordinated market economies. Other authors describe the Swiss model as organized capitalism. Other contributions emphasize the ambiguities of the Swiss model, preferring the term hybrid model.

## Research question {.smaller}

> [What social basis for a neoliberal transformation of the Swiss model ?]{style="color:red;"}

Research in three parts

1.  Short history of the Swiss social blocs since 1848, based on the literature

-   Then, two empirical analyses based on two different approach to social blocs

2.  Series of regressions following the bi-dimensional "political compass" approach
    -   Implicit definition of social blocs, which are pre-defined groups based on income and education levels [@piketty_capital_2019] or social classes [@oesch_electoral_2018]
    -   Series of logit models regressing party support, political leaning and policy preferences on socio-economic characteristics
3.  A multidimensional and bottom-up clustering approach, using latent class analysis [@amable_search_2021]

::: notes
Switzerland thus went under an important process of institutional change during the last decades, which moved it closer to the neoliberal model, without making the country entirely neoliberal (thus why some authors classified the country as a hybrid model, like france for instance).

In the neorealist approach, the stability and change of a socio-economic model depends on the different social blocs which support or not the model. Thus, the objective of my research is to explore the social basis for a neoliberal transformation of the Swiss model. It is important to note that my thesis provides only the first steps for this analysis. I restrained the research to three main parts:

## Hypotheses {.smaller}

1.  *Brahmin left versus merchant right hypotheses*

    -   BvsM1. The support for the left and left-wing parties should be negatively associated with education and income levels in the first time periods. The negative association with education should then decrease and become positive over time.
    -   BvsM2. The support for the right and right-wing parties should be positively associated with education and income in the first time periods and the positive association with education should decrease over time.

2.  *Bourgeois bloc hypotheses*

    -   BB1. The support for redistribution and state intervention should decrease with education and income. Support for equal rights between Swiss citizen and foreigners should increase with education and income.
    -   BB2. Support for right-wing parties and the right should increase with both income and education levels.

-   Left bloc: clusters 2 and 8 are composed by wealthy and well-educated individuals, only cluster 12 is composed by popular elements. Potential targets of the left bloc, clusters 4 and 1, are rather composed by middle/lower-middle classes.

-   Liberal conservative bloc: clusters 3 and 7 are the least wealthy and educated; 9 and 10 among the most wealthy and educated.

## Discussion of the results {.smaller}

Regression analysis:

-   Results validate brahmin left vs merchant right hypothesis more than the WPID's own results

-   A few exceptions: difference between second highest and lowest income groups for left leaning

-   Analyses of the WPID extended to abstention and policy preferences

12 clusters model for 1999:

-   Dominant liberal conservative bloc, which is nonetheless divided over European integration and some economic issues (high income taxation)

-   The predominance of anti-EU and popular groups in the liberal conservative bloc could explain the failure of a neoliberal/bourgeois bloc strategy and the slowdown of the reforms after 2003.

-   Left bloc: incentives to attract parts of cluster 1 and 4, which are more moderate

## Slow-down of the reforms after the 90s

## Limits and further research

Five levels for a theoretical framework for institutional change [@amable_neorealist_2008]:

1.  Ideology

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
2.  Demands of social actors
:::

3.  Political mediation
4.  [Identification of social groups]{style="color:red;"} and of which benefit/loose from economic dynamics and public policy
5.  Institutions

## Limits and further research {.smaller}

My master's thesis is only a first step for a neorealist analysis of Switzerland's institutional change. There is still a lot to be done.

In further work, I envisage to do the following:

-   Better assess Switzerland's political stability
-   Conduct LCA for more recent periods (for instance 2019)
    -   Other periods such as 2003 or 2007 could also be interesting
-   Run a more complex and wide regression analysis
    -   Multilevel models & including 2016-2020 data
-   Take ideology more into account
-   Explore institutional and economic dynamics
-   Identification of Switzerland's demand regime from a post-Keynesian perspective
-   Better explain how social groups' interests are protected/discarded by economic dynamics and public policy
