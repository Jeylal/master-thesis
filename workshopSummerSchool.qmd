## Introduction {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="55"}
-   Objective: present the neorealist approach to institutions, institutional change and social conflict developed by Bruno Amable and Stefano Palombarini

-   Focus on the theoretical framework (first part), empirics (second part), with example taken from my own applied research on Switzerland.

-   Concluding activity: build your own social bloc

## Foundation of a neorealist approach {.smaller}

::: columns

-   Offer a positive approach (avoid normativity)
-   Link political, economic and social dynamics
-   Explore the *causes* of institutional change
-   Fundamental question: in a system tainted by contradictions and crises, why do we observe periods of relative stability ? How is social conflict regulated ?

## Foundations of the neorealist approach: social conflict

-   The social structure being heterogeneous, individuals' interests are varied
-   This diversity of social expectations leads to contradiction and opposition of interests between actors
-   There is no "general interest" or "general welfare" as in normative approaches (Marxism, mainstream econ...) ==\> social conflict cannot be abolished, but merely regulated

## Regulation of social conflict: Ideology (1) {.smaller}

-   Shapes actors' representation of the world, their position in society and thus their interests

-   Reduces heterogeneity from the structure by making agents converge to same political demands

-   Social expectations are not only shaped by class, stratification and the position in the structure

-   Reduces the space of acceptable political demands and homogenize the diversity of interests to a certain extent, by disregarding some demands deemed as socially unacceptable

## Regulation of social conflict: institutions {.smaller}

-   Defined as rules of the social game

    -   Formal (written, as constitutions and laws in general) or informal (conventions, norms)

-   Are the result of past social compromises

-   Shape the representation of interests and the formation of political supply and strategies, as well as macro dynamics

    ::: callout-important
    ## What institutions are not

    They are not practice, strategies, rules of thumb and must not be confounded with organizations (the state, political parties, interest groups etc.). Organizations are the *players* and institution the *rules* of the game.
    :::

## Five institutional areas {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
1.  Product market competition

    -   Degree of competition, cartels

2.  Wage-labour nexus and labour market institutions

    -   Labour flexibility, employment protection, minimum wage policy...

3.  Financial sector and corporate governance

    -   Bank-based or market-based finance, power of shareholders...

4.  Social protection and the welfare state

    -   Pension, insurance, invalidity systems, unemployment benefits...

5.  Education system

    -   Vocational or general training, specific or general skills...

## Five types of capitalism {.smaller}

-   Market-based model

    -   Competitive product-market, complementary with labour market flexibility, and highly developed financial markets. Weak welfare state. (UK, US, New-Zealand)

-   Continental model

    -   Less competitive product-market, more developed employment protection and welfare state, centralized and/or bank-based financial system. Coordinated wage bargaining. (France, Germany, Switzerland...)

Along with the Mediterranean model (Italy, Spain...), the Social-democratic model (Sweden, Norway...) and the Asian model (Japan).

## Political mediation

Institutional change is the result of political strategies devised by political actors

-   Political actors mediate a social compromise between the heterogeneous demands

-   They devise a specific strategy of economic policy and institutional design

-   They select which interests to protect and to disregard to aggregate support

-   Idea that the ruling actors cannot govern only by brute force, but need a certain degree of support

## Main concepts {.smaller}

::: columns
::: column
-   Socio-economic groups

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Groups of agents with common position in the economic structure (income groups, class, education level...)
:::

-   Socio-political groups

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Groups of agents sharing common policy preferences regarding macroeconomic policy and the socio-economic model
:::

-   Social blocs

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Socio-political groups aggregated by a political strategy.
:::
:::

::: column
-   Political equilibrium

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Stable institutional configuration supported by a [**dominant social bloc**]{style="color:red;"} aggregated by a winning political strategy
:::

-   Political crisis

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Break-up of the dominant social bloc
:::

-   Systemic crisis

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Situation in which no political strategy is able to aggregate a new dominant social bloc

## Political economy analysis

Elements to consider:

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
-   Socio-economic model (institutions, complementarity, hierarchy)
:::

-   Macroeconomic policy

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
-   Identification of social blocs
:::

-   Political actors and strategies
:::

-   Ideology

## The Swiss model

A model particularly difficult to grasp, even in the existing literature

-   Liberal corporatism [@katzenstein_small_1985]

-   Liberal capitalism [@blaas_swiss_1992]

-   Coordinated market economies [@hall_varieties_2001]

-   Continental model [@amable_diversity_2003]

-   Organised capitalism [@charles_fast_2024]

-   Hybrid model [@trampusch_switzerland_2011]

## Switzerland's institutional paradox {.smaller}

Presence of institutions very close to the market-based model:

-   Flexible labour market, low employment protection, weak labour unions
-   Absence of Keynesian-style macroeconomic policies
-   Weak welfare state, with prominence of private, market-based insurance schemes (health insurance, second and third pillars of pension funds)
-   Highly competitive and de-regulated exporting sector

But co-existing with non-market, coordinated institutions:

-   Protectionist, insider-oriented and bank-based financial system
-   Predominance of vocational training
-   Highly cartelized and protected domestic sector with low degree of competition

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
=\> What kind of dominant social bloc made this model possible ?
:::

## The Swiss dominant social bloc {.smaller}

Bourgeois bloc

:   Coalition between the governing right wing parties (SVP, FDP, CVP) and business interests associations (EconomieSuisse, USAM...)

- This bloc reconciles the contradictory interests of the dual structure of the economy (protected & regulated domestic sectors vs highly competitive and de-regulated exporting sectors)

Several issues with this definition:

-   A social bloc should not be reduced to a political alliance/coalition
-   No information about socio-political groups, and how the latter are aggregated through political strategy

## The 90s: a potential political crisis

![](docs/intro_files/figure-html/fig-trust2-1.png){width="492"}

## Political strategies during the 90s

Left bloc strategy (main actor: Swiss Socialist Party)

-   De-cartelization

-   Reform the financial sector (bank secrecy, Vinkulierung...)

-   Social reforms (welfare state, social and employment protection)

-   Pro-EU integration

## Left bloc strategy: a Swiss Third Way ?

> > "In the recent past, the Socialist Party has often neglected the interests of the working class, thereby undermining the left-wing value of equality. Of course, the objective of freedom is more easily asserted today, because it can rely on a broader electoral base. The excluded are in fact in the minority, and therefore do not represent an interesting electoral mass."[@rennwald_vive_1998, p.227, author's translation]

## The neoliberal-bourgeois strategy

Promote a neoliberal transformation of the Swiss model through:

::: columns
::: column
-   European integration
-   Liberalization and privatization
-   Welfare state retrenchment
-   Competition policy (de-cartelization)
-   Stopping compensation measures (ex: subsidies to farms)

## SVP's "populist" strategy

Promote neoliberal transformation of the Swiss model, but with a certain form of "cultural" compensation

-   anti-European integration
-   Liberalization and privatization
-   Welfare state retrenchment
-   Against immigration

## Left bloc strategy: the appeal of center groups {.smaller}

> > "The Socialist Party wants an efficient state. It wants to limit the tax burden and reduce public debt. For nothing is more anti-social than living at the expense of future generations. \[...\] The SP does not want a welfare state that paralyzes individual responsibility. It therefore attaches great importance to the balance between rights and duties in social policy."

## Evolution of political supply

![](docs/part1_files/figure-html/fig-manifesto-1.png)

## Conclusion

-   The Swiss model is supported by liberal-conservative bloc, aggregated by a coalition between liberals (PLR-CVP) and conservatives (SVP)

-   This dominant social bloc can explain much of the evolution of Swiss institutions

-   The crisis of the 90s mirrors a crisis within the liberal-conservative bloc

## What's the state of play now ?

-   Institutional change has slowed down in Switzerland since the 90s

-   However, there are still some interesting evolution

-   Can we analyze the changes or stability by applying a latent class analysis using more recent data ?

## How have things change two decades later ?

- SVP still the dominant party

- The Liberals still in decline and trying to find a new strategy

- The left still a minority

- Some small but important institutional change (pension reform, welfare state)

## Try to aggregate your own social bloc ! {.smaller}

- As a concluding activity, I propose that you have a look to my most recent latent class analysis using Swiss post-election survey data for 2019 (see link below)

<https://github.com/Jeylal/master-thesis/raw/master/lca%20estimations/selects2019_2024_13clusters_results.xlsx>

- Have a look at the profile sheet and the 3stepsprobsvote sheet

- Consider one political strategy you are interested in (Socialist, liberal, conservative, social-ecologist, pro-EU strategy...) ==> can this strategy aggregate large enough socio-political groups (clusters) ?
