	abstract = {This research paper discusses the role of institutions in the rapid growth and successful international integration of Switzerland during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In analysing the emergence and consolidation of the institutions whose existence was crucial, the paper looks both at the political institutions that managed conflicts and promoted cooperation between private and public actors and the economic institutions that, on the one hand, compensated the groups that fell behind in the developmental process (e.g., agricultural subsidies, high tolerance for domestic cartels, tariffs for some industries, institutions for labour representation) and, on the other hand, enhanced productivity. In addition, the absence of some institutions such as a patent law and an independent central bank was also crucial in the Swiss case, even though these two institutions are regarded as pre-requisites of development by today’s economic orthodoxy. The paper concludes by drawing lessons for today’s developing countries.},

	abstract = {As a legacy of the early stages of its state building process, Switzerland continues to be characterised by a cohesive elite whose members simultaneously occupy political and economic positions. Whereas sectoral analyses of the economic or political elite are widespread, few researchers have scrutinised the connections between business and politics. Therefore, this paper focuses on the linkages between the economic and political fields. Based on a joint multiple correspondence analysis of the {CEOs} and board members of the 110 largest Swiss companies in 2000 and 256 parliamentary members, we examine the interactional and objective relations between the fields through an analysis of personal interchange, participation in meeting places and structural homology of educational capital. It appears that the connections between elites are cumulative: in each field, the dominant faction shares a background in law or engineering, participates in meeting places, and personally moves between the fields. Reversely, the dominated, which come from a rather heterogeneous educational background, are excluded from interactional relations and moves between the two fields. That the two forms of elite coordination coincide and reinforce each other could be typical for a small country with little differentiated fields, where elite members quickly get to know each other and can easily meet on a regular basis.},

Furthermore, the cultural diversity and the federal structure of Switzerland led to the evolution of a variety of rules within the country itself.

This article describes two simple techniques for extracting such insights, which allow change over time in y to be a function of change over time in x and/or of a time-invariant x. The article presents results from simulation studies that assess the techniques in the presence of complications that are likely to arise with real-world data, and concludes with applications to the issues of generalized social trust and postmaterialist values, using data from World/European Values Surveys.},

Specifically, the article shows how this ‘income inequality effect’ encourages poor people to vote for {RRPs}, while it concurrently discourages rich people from doing so. This finding supports the social identity hypothesis, which states that social identity (a micro-level factor) intermediates income inequality effect (a macro-level factor) on voter support for {RRPs}. The article's results suggest, further, that income inequality has different effects between the main supporters of {RRPs} with dissimilar occupations (e.g., manual workers and the petty bourgeoisie) because they belong to different income groups; and that country-level factors may have different effects on people regarding their support for {RRPs}.},

Ce livre se fait l’écho de ces changements, au travers d’un état des lieux complet et transdisciplinaire des connaissances sur la politique suisse en ce début de 21e siècle.

Il traite tour à tour des institutions fondamentales (fédéralisme, neutralité, démocratie directe), des acteurs politiques étatiques (gouvernement, Parlement) et non étatiques (partis politiques, groupes d’intérêt), des processus de prise de décision, ainsi que des arcanes et des détenteurs du pouvoir. L’auteur adopte une approche résolument comparative et situe la politique suisse dans son environnement international et européen.

D’une grande clarté, cet ouvrage vient pallier le manque d’un ouvrage de synthèse sur la politique suisse en langue française. Il s’adresse aux chercheuses et chercheurs et aux étudiantes et étudiants en sciences sociales et politiques, et plus généralement au public averti intéressé par la politique suisse.},

Bipolar competition is becoming tripolar, as the two dominant party poles of the twentieth century – the left and the centre-right – are challenged by a third pole of the radical right. Between 2000 and 2015, the radical right has secured more than 12 per cent of the vote in over ten Western European countries. This article shows how electoral competition between the three party poles plays out at the micro level of social classes. It presents a model of class voting that distinguishes between classes that are a party's preserve, classes that are contested strongholds of two parties and classes over which there is an open competition. Using seven rounds of the European Social Survey, it shows that sociocultural professionals form the party preserve of the left, and large employers and managers the preserve of the centre-right. However, the radical right competes with the centre-right for the votes of small business owners, and it challenges the left over its working-class stronghold. These two contested strongholds attest to the co-existence of old and new patterns of class voting. Old patterns are structured by an economic conflict: Production workers vote for the left and small business owners for the centre-right based on their economic attitudes. In contrast, new patterns are linked to the rise of the radical right and structured by a cultural conflict.},

I hypothesize: (1) that people have a variety of needs which are given high or low priority according to their degree of fulfillment: people act on behalf of their most important unsatisfied need, giving relatively little attention to needs already satisfied—except that (2) people tend to retain the value priorities adopted in their formative years throughout adult life. In contemporary Western Europe, needs for physical safety and economic security are relatively well satisfied for an unprecedentedly large share of the population. Younger, more affluent groups have been formed entirely under these conditions, and seem relatively likely to give top priority to fulfillment of needs which remain secondary to the older and less affluent majority of the population. Needs for belonging and intellectual and esthetic self-fulfillment (characterized as “post-bourgeois” values) may take top priorities among the former group. Survey data from six countries indicate that the value priorities of the more affluent postwar group do contrast with those of groups raised under conditions of lesser economic and physical security. National patterns of value priorities correspond to the given nation's economic history, moreover, suggesting that the age-group differences reflect the persistence of preadult experiences, rather than life cycle effects. The distinctive value priorities imply distinctive political behavior—being empirically linked with preferences for specific political issues and political parties in a predictable fashion. If the respective age cohorts retain their present value priorities, we would expect long-term shifts in the political goals and patterns of political partisanship prevailing in these societies.},

	abstract = {This paper combines post-electoral surveys to study the transformation of the structure of political cleavages in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland over the last five decades. Despite their history of linguistic, regional, and religious conflicts, all four countries share a common tradition of consensus decision-making, which has remained until the present. Yet, the weakening of historical cleavages, the emergence of new political formations (i.e. Green parties on the left and anti-immigration parties on the right), and the rise of new divides have significantly transformed their party systems since the 1980s. Support for green and left-wing parties among highest-educated voters, and for anti-immigration parties among the lower-educated has grown, while top-income earners have remained instead more supportive of the traditional right. Both the rise of new green and anti-immigration parties, but also changes within old parties have thus led to the emergence of “multi-elite party systems”, as it has been shown in other Western democracies.},

Piketty's core argument in this part of the book is that the left now represents the highly educated and that, as a result, the redistributive preferences of the working class do not find representation in today's party systems. We address these claims building on existing political science research that has investigated the transformation of politics in advanced capitalist societies. We argue, first, that the educational divide cannot be adequately analyzed by looking at a left and a right bloc, but crucially needs to pay attention to the rise of green/left-libertarian and radical right parties. Second, we contend that the new middle classes that support parties of the left are largely in favor of economic redistribution. Analyzing data from the European Social Survey in 11 West European countries from 2002 to 2018, we show that the effect of education on voting left or right is indeed largely driven by green/left-libertarian and radical right parties, while there is little empirical evidence that social democratic parties represent the educational elite. We also find that redistributive preferences remain at the heart of voting behavior and that, especially for educated voters, these preferences determine whether someone votes for a party of the left rather than the right.},

	title = {Brahmin Left vs Merchant Right: Rising Inequality and the Changing Structure of Political Conflict},
	abstract = {Using post-electoral surveys from France, Britain and the {US}, this paper documents a striking long-run evolution in the structure of political cleavages. In the 1950s-1960s, the vote for left-wing (socialist-labour-democratic) parties was associated with lower education and lower income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher education voters, giving rise to a “multiple-elite” party system in the 2000s-2010s: high-education elites now vote for the “left”, while highincome/high-wealth elites still vote for the “right” (though less and less so). I argue that this can contribute to explain rising inequality and the lack of democratic response to it, as well as the rise of “populism”. I also discuss the origins of this evolution (rise of globalization/migration cleavage, and/or educational expansion per se) as well as future prospects: “multiple-elite” stabilization; complete realignment of the party system along a “globalists” (high-education, high-income) vs “nativists” (loweducation, low-income) cleavage; return to class-based redistributive conflict (either from an internationalist or nativist perspective). Two main lessons emerge. First, with multi-dimensional inequality, multiple political equilibria and bifurcations can occur. Next, without a strong egalitarian-internationalist platform, it is difficult to unite loweducation, low-income voters from all origins within the same party.},

In the 1950s and 1960s, the vote for social democratic, socialist, and affiliated parties was associated with lower-educated and low-income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher-educated voters, giving rise in the 2010s to a disconnection between the effects of income and education on the vote: higher-educated voters now vote for the “left,” while high-income voters continue to vote for the “right.” This transition has been accelerated by the rise of green and anti-immigration movements, whose distinctive feature is to concentrate the votes of the higher-educated and lower-educated electorates. Combining our database with historical data on political parties’ programs, we provide evidence that the reversal of the education cleavage is strongly linked to the emergence of a new “sociocultural” axis of political conflict.},

The analysis is based on an empirical study of the policy demands of the electorate based on the French electoral survey 2012. A latent class model leads to a partition of the French electorate in eighteen clusters.

	title = {The political economy of neo-liberalism in Italy and France},
	abstract = {There are many apparent similarities between the current political and economic situations of France and Italy. The mainstream view is that at least part of the neo-liberal strategy could be a solution to the economic problems of both variants of the European model of capitalism. However, the difficulties met by the implementation of these strategies by Sarkozy and Berlusconi lead to believe that the success or failure of neo-liberalisation has less to do with its (lack of) macroeconomic merits than with the stability of the socio-political alliances that support it. In this respect, France and Italy are markedly different. This paper shows that even if the ‘hard core’ of the neoliberal social bloc is roughly the same in both countries, this core constitutes a minority of the electorate; a neoliberal strategy must therefore rely on an extended social coalition, which might not be similar between countries. The Great Recession revealed part of the structural characteristics that set both countries apart. The aim of this article is to show that the consideration of the different socio-political alliances found in each country can help to understand how Italy and France ended up on different economic trajectories.},

Social groups may be in a dominant or dominated position in one or the other dimension, and the nature of social conﬂict reﬂects the diﬀerences in positions of the various social groups in these dimensions. Political stability hinges on the existence of a dominant social bloc, i.e. a social alliance supporting the ruling political actors. The implementation of institutional change by political actors is driven by the search for support. Crisis situations correspond to the rupture of the dominant social bloc. Attempts to emerge from the crisis with the reconstitution of a dominant social bloc will have more or less chance of success depending on the possibility of ﬁnding a political strategy that can make the expectations of social groups with diﬀerent perceived interests compatible. Using examples from the French and Italian economic and political situations in recent decades, we show how the proposed analytical framework can inform the study of institutional change in situations of social crisis.},

These crises are linked. First, because the institutional reforms undertaken since the 1980s have changed French capitalism, its institutional complementarities, the proﬁle of socio-political groups, and have contributed to destabilizing social alliances. Second, because the political crisis has pushed policy-makers to turn to institutional change as a necessary condition for opening up new spaces of mediation.

The current situation would be characterised by a dominance of ‘elites’ in left and right constituencies: financially rich elites vote for the right (merchant right), high-education elites vote for the left (brahmin left). Using {ISSP} data for 17 countries, this paper tests the influence of income and education inequalities on political leaning and a variety of policy preferences: the support for redistribution, for investment in public education, for globalisation and immigration. Results show that income levels are still relevant for the left-right divide, but the influence differs across education levels. Our findings also point to a certain convergence of opinion among the Brahmin left and the merchant right, which could lead to a new political divide beyond the left and the right, uniting a bloc bourgeois.},

It argues that the ﬁrm-based approach of the Varieties of Capitalism literature cannot satisfactorily integrate the political aspects of institutional change and must in one way or another rely on some type of economic functionalism. By linking explicitly political strategies and demands for institutional change, a neorealist approach can exploit the concepts of complementarity and hierarchy of institutions. Different types of institutional change may take place in situations of political equilibrium, political crisis or systemic crisis.},

After outlining the different institutional foundations of economic governance in both countries (fragmented state, constrained executive power and bourgeois dominance in Switzerland, centralised state, stronger executive power and strong labour in Austria), the paper assesses general trends in economic policy and economic performance over the last 20 years. In a second section, the paper assesses continuity and change across different spheres of the economy: economic regulation and corporate governance, labour market policy and industrial relations, and welfare state reform. Despite a general trend towards a more market-driven economic model, different patterns of change can be observed both between countries and different spheres of the economy.},

	abstract = {In the 1990s, sociologists engaged in a heated controversy about class voting. Although empirical evidence accumulated, positions remained surprisingly divided. This paper argues that this disagreement is due to two factors. Firstly, it reflects diverging understandings as to the concept of class voting. Secondly, it is explained by the use of class models that do not satisfactorily represent today's social stratification in Western Europe. In consequence, this paper uses a detailed multi-class schema and examines two cleavages running through the social structure: (i) the economic divide separating holders of organizational power from the workingclass, (ii) the cultural divide opposing high-skilled classes engaged in interpersonal work settings (who hold a liberation view of community) from low-skilled classes occupied in object-related tasks (who hold an authoritarian view of community). Based on individual level data, our analyses show that classes continue to systematically differ in their party support. There is strong electoral evidence for the traditional economic cleavage in Britain's and Germany's class structure, while in Switzerland the cultural cleavage seems more salient. Hence, class voting continues but appears to involve more (and different) class-party alliances than just leftvoting by the woking class. Among others, we find salaried professionals in the social and cultural services to rally the libertarian left, while managers support parties on the right. Moreover, where a right-wing populist party alternative exists, it attracts disproportionate support from production workers and small business owners.},

	abstract = {n his introductory presentation, Professor Hanspeter Kriesi from the University of Zurich focused on the different areas of influence of economy and politics. That is why problems often arise. He stated that increasing globalization challenges basic requirements of democracy where decision-makers are approved by those who are affected by the decisions. However, this does not always apply in a globalized and increasingly interdependent world. This is also true because political integration lags behind economic integration. Decisions which are relevant to us are increasingly taken by committees and people who were not elected by us nor indirectly depend on the representatives we elected. The second part of his presentation was dedicated to the frequently discussed power of the media. From a pessimist point of view, the growing influence of media leads to spectacularization, personalization and trivialization of politics. It often occurs that politicians adapt themselves to the media in order to present themselves. The increasing diversification of media channels bears the risk that people only gather information which confirms and strengthens their own view of the world leading to a polarization of politics and all unpleasant consequences related to it. From an optimistic point of view, however, the diversity of media channels fosters dialogue between the citizens themselves and political decision-makers.},

Nor did class conflict produce in Switzerland a deeply fragmented and compartmentalized society such as is found in other small European Democracies. It is argued that decentralized social, economic and political institutions; moderate and continuous rates of economic development; cross-cutting cleavages and overlapping group affiliations; small size, and to a lesser extent political neutrality contributed to Switzerland's relatively calm “class struggle.” It is further noted that these explanations seem to fit the Swiss case best when enveloped in Lipset and Rokkan's developmental thesis of European cleavage development, in which it is argued that nineteenth and twentieth century political institutions are more able to mediate class conflict successfully when not burdened by the residue of the unresolved political conflicts of earlier periods in the development of the modern political state. In sum, by the time working-class politics reached high tide in Switzerland, most nation building issues had been resolved, and effective democratic processes had been firmly put in place.},

Despite their history of linguistic, regional, and religious conflicts, all four countries share a common tradition of consensus decision-making, which has remained until the present. Yet, the weakening of historical cleavages, the emergence of new political formations (i.e. Green parties on the left and anti-immigration parties on the right), and the rise of new divides have significantly transformed their party systems since the 1980s. Support for green and left-wing parties among highest-educated voters, and for anti-immigration parties among the lower-educated has grown, while top-income earners have remained instead more supportive of the traditional right. Both the rise of new green and anti-immigration parties, but also changes within old parties have thus led to the emergence of “multi-elite party systems”, as it has been shown in other Western democracies.},

In the 1950s and 1960s, the vote for social democratic, socialist, and affiliated parties was associated with lower-educated and low-income voters. It has gradually become associated with higher-educated voters, giving rise in the 2010s to a disconnection between the effects of income and education on the vote: higher-educated voters now vote for the “left,” while high-income voters continue to vote for the “right.” This transition has been accelerated by the rise of green and anti-immigration movements, whose distinctive feature is to concentrate the votes of the higher-educated and lower-educated electorates. Combining our database with historical data on political parties’ programs, we provide evidence that the reversal of the education cleavage is strongly linked to the emergence of a new “sociocultural” axis of political conflict.},

This ambitious work examines changes in religious beliefs, in motives for work, in the issues that give rise to political conflict, in the importance people attach to having children and families, and in attitudes toward divorce, abortion, and homosexuality. Ronald Inglehart's earlier book, The Silent Revolution (Princeton, 1977), broke new ground by discovering a major intergenerational shift in the values of the populations of advanced industrial societies. This new volume demonstrates that this value shift is part of a much broader process of cultural change that is gradually transforming political, economic, and social life in these societies.  Inglehart uses a massive body of time-series survey data from twenty-six nations, gathered from 1970 through 1988, to analyze the cultural changes that are occurring as younger generations gradually replace older ones in the adult population. These changes have far-reaching political implications, and they seem to be transforming the economic growth rates of societies and the kind of economic development that is pursued.},

Insecurity has the opposite effect, stimulating an Authoritarian Reflex in which people close ranks behind strong leaders, with strong in-group solidarity, rejection of outsiders, and rigid conformity to group norms. The 35 years of exceptional security experienced by developed democracies after {WWII} brought pervasive cultural changes, including the rise of Green parties and the spread of democracy. During the past 35 years, economic growth continued, but virtually all of the gains went to those at the top; the less-educated experienced declining existential security, fueling support for Populist Authoritarian phenomena such as Brexit, France’s National Front and Trump’s takeover of the Republican party. This raises two questions: (1) “What motivates people to support Populist Authoritarian movements?” And (2) “Why is the populist authoritarian vote so much higher now than it was several decades ago in high-income countries?” The two questions have different answers. Support for populist authoritarian parties is motivated by a backlash against cultural change. From the start, younger Postmaterialist birth cohorts supported environmentalist parties, while older, less secure cohorts supported authoritarian xenophobic parties, in an enduring intergenerational value clash. But for the past three decades, strong period effects have been working to increase support for xenophobic parties: economic gains have gone almost entirely to those at the top, while a large share of the population experienced declining real income and job security, along with a large influx of immigrants and refugees. Cultural backlash explains why given individuals support Populist Authoritarian movements. Declining existential security explains why support for these movements is greater now than it was thirty years ago.},

Depuis, elle n'a pas cessé de retravailler ses concepts, ses méthodes, et d'étendre son champ d'application.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief non-mathematical introduction to Latent Class Analysis ({LCA}) and a demonstration for researchers new to the analysis technique in pharmacy and pharmacy administration. {LCA} is a mathematical technique for examining relationships among observed variables when there may be collections of unobserved categorical variables. Traditionally, {LCA} focused on polytomous observed variables, but recent work has extended the types of data that can be utilized. Included in this introduction are basic guidelines for the information that should be part of a manuscript submitted for review. For the analysis, {LatentGold} is used, but I also include basic R code for running {LCA} and {LC} Regressions with the {poLCA} package.},

Sometimes, measurement models are identical across groups in {LCA}. In other situations, the measurement models may differ, suggesting that the latent structure itself is different between groups. Tests of measurement invariance shed light on this distinction. We created an R package glca that implements procedures for exploring differences in latent class structure between populations, taking multilevel data structure into account. The glca package deals with the fixed-effect {LCA} and the nonparametric random-effect {LCA}; the former can be applied in the situation where populations are segmented by the observed group variable itself, whereas the latter can be used when there are too many levels in the group variable to make a meaningful group comparisons by identifying a group-level latent variable. The glca package consists of functions for statistical test procedures for exploring group differences in various {LCA} models considering multilevel data structure.},

Such models have a measurement part (essentially the latent class model) and a structural (causal) part (essentially a system of logit equations). In the three-step approach, a stand-alone measurement model is first defined and its parameters are estimated. Individual predicted scores on the latent variables are then computed from the parameter estimates of the measurement model and the individual observed scoring patterns on the indicators. Finally, these predicted scores are used in the causal part and treated as observed variables. We show that such a naive use of predicted latent scores cannot be recommended since it leads to a systematic underestimation of the strength of the association among the variables in the structural part of the models. However, a simple correction procedure can eliminate this systematic bias. This approach is illustrated on simulated and real data. A method that uses multiple imputation to account for the fact that the predicted latent variables are random variables can produce standard errors for the parameters in the structural part of the model.},

	abstract = {Clustering analysis identifying unknown heterogenous subgroups of a population (or a sample) has become increasingly popular along with the popularity of machine learning techniques. Although there are many software packages running clustering analysis, there is a lack of packages conducting clustering analysis within a structural equation modeling framework. The package, {gscaLCA} which is implemented in the R statistical computing environment, was developed for conducting clustering analysis and has been extended to a latent variable modeling. More specifically, by applying both fuzzy clustering ({FC}) algorithm and generalized structured component analysis ({GSCA}), the package {gscaLCA} computes membership prevalence and item response probabilities as posterior probabilities, which is applicable in mixture modeling such as latent class analysis in statistics. As a hybrid model between data clustering in classifications and model-based mixture modeling approach, fuzzy clusterwise {GSCA}, denoted as {gscaLCA}, encompasses many advantages from both methods: (1) soft partitioning from {FC} and (2) efficiency in estimating model parameters with bootstrap method via resolution of global optimization problem from {GSCA}. The main function, {gscaLCA}, works for both binary and ordered categorical variables. In addition, {gscaLCA} can be used for latent class regression as well. Visualization of profiles of latent classes based on the posterior probabilities is also available in the package {gscaLCA}. This paper contributes to providing a methodological tool, {gscaLCA} that applied researchers such as social scientists and medical researchers can apply clustering analysis in their research.},

The free open-source R-package package {tidySEM} implements the practices recommended here. It is easy for beginners to adopt thanks to user-friendly wrapper functions, and yet remains relevant for expert users as its models are integrated within the {OpenMx} structural equation modeling framework and remain fully customizable.

	abstract = {This brief looks at the evolution of income inequality in Europe from the perspective of the update to the Distributional National Accounts series for Europe (1980-2019) on the World Inequality Database. We highlight three main results. First, European countries were less unequal between themselves in 2019 than at any point since 1980, as measured by the average income diﬀerences between the richer West and the poorer East. This aggregate result conceals persistently large income diﬀerences across countries, but they are quickly converging due to core Eastern {EU}-member states catching up with regressing Western {EU}-member states in the Southern periphery. This convergence has become clearer since the Great Recession. Second, income inequality within countries has grown signiﬁcantly since 1980, but less so since the Great Recession, with wide discrepancies between countries in levels and growth rates. Third, Western European countries continue to lead on redistributive outcomes due to greater redistribution between the top 10\% and the bottom 50\%. However, regressive tendencies have emerged in both East and West over the last 10 years. Administrative data production on income diﬀerences in Europe still has much room to improve, especially if we are to adequately account for the distributional changes of the years ahead.},

We argue that, even though the changes might seem limited in international comparison, the adoption of the new Stock corporation law reflects a profound change in the dominant conception of the stock corporation. In fact, the analysis of the decision-making process reveals a fundamental change in actors' believes and preferences. This fundamental change in preferences caused the traditionally dominant political and economic coalition between managers and owners - which was based on the stakeholder paradigm of the firm - to collapse. If conservative members of the Federal Parliament have managed - due to particularities of the Swiss polity - to limit the legal changes, it appears clearly that by 1990, the shareholder view of the firm has started to become a widely agreed-upon idea and the formerly well-established stakeholder paradigm had become a thing of the past.},

This is particularly true in the ﬁeld of corporate governance and more precisely visible in the Stock Corporation Law, the supervision of the stock exchanges and accounting rules. Due to very lax legal rules, mechanisms of “private governance” complemented the minimal legal framework in these three ﬁelds. Over the last twenty or so years, these mechanisms of self-regulation have nonetheless undergone profound change. In fact, private self-regulation has been incrementally formalised and replaced by more speciﬁc public regulations in ﬁve important ﬁelds: the transferability of shares, proxy-voting by banks, takeover bids, supervision of the stock exchanges and accounting rules. Due to changes in the international context, to the shifting preferences of important economic actors, and to the emergence of new actors (institutional investors and accountants), the legal framework of Swiss corporate governance has been reformed in a signiﬁcant way.},

	abstract = {The literature on neo-corporatist agreements in social and labor market policy in the 1990s points to a decline of concertation in European countries with a long-standing tradition of corporatist negotiation. This article identifies a similar trend in Switzerland and argues that three destabilizing factors account for it: 1) retrenchment pressure and ideological polarization prevent compromises; 2) the emergence of new social demands and interests challenges the homogeneity and legitimacy of peak organizations and thus their bargaining power; 3) increasing media coverage tends to open up the traditionally confidential and selective sphere of corporatist negotiation and weakens the social partners’ ability to reach agreements. The impact of these factors on neo-corporatist bargaining is tested in Switzerland, a case where corporatist negotiations used to be particularly decisive in social policy making. Empirical evidence comes from a cross-time comparison of two major social policies: Unemployment insurance and pension reforms in the 1970s and in the 1990s. In the last decade, the main locus of decision-making shifted from the sphere of interest groups to partisan politics. In parliament, the political parties were able to draft bills enjoying wide acceptance thanks to compensations offered to groups particularly vulnerable to new social risks.},

	abstract = {During the 1990s, despite not being a member of the {EU} and despite the existence of numerous veto-points, Switzerland displayed an unexpectedly high degree of adjustment to inter- and supranational regulations, particularly in the field of economic regulatory reforms. The article explains this high capacity of adjustment by focusing on three major cases: the reform of competition policy, the liberalization of the telecom sector and the reforms of the public procurement policy. By examining the interactions between changes at the international level, the induced changing power relations and actor strategies at the domestic level, as well as national institutional constraints, we provide an empirical analysis of these reform processes. The article shows that domestic adjustment followed to a large extent similar patterns in all cases: the government and some administrative actors played an exceptionally strong leading role in formulating the content of the reforms and in shaping the policy processes. Further, we identify unusually exclusive decision- making processes, in which the opponents to the reforms were marginalized. Nevertheless, some strategic concessions were thereafter made to the "losers' of the reforms, in order to overcome the veto-point of the optional referendum which might have threatened their success.},

L”ajustement' à l'évolution de l'environnement international ne se limite plus aux secteurs déjà soumis à la concurrence internationale mais touche l'ensemble de l'économie: agriculture, entreprises publiques, marchés publics, marché du travail, réglementation de la main d'oeuvre étrangère ou encore promotion de la concurrence sur le marché intérieur. Alors que l'ancienne législation sur les cartels se caractérisait par sa permissivité et sa faible portée, la nouvelle loi s'apparente dans ses grandes lignes au droit européen de la concurrence. Après une présentation des particularités de l'ancienne loi, le texte analyse le processus de révision: les impulsions internes et externes, le rôle des acteurs impliqués et les coalitions qui ont permis l'aboutissement de cette révision. Pour terminer, nous revenons sur quelques considérations théoriques plus générales.},

In the 1990s, welfare state reforms drew on “modernizing” coalitions between {FDP} (Liberals), {CVP} (Christian Democrats) and {SP} (Social Democrats) combining retrenchment and “recalibration”. In the 2000s the {FDP} and {CVP} increasingly sided with the {SVP} in right-wing coalitions pushing retrenchment alone. The article shows that changes in party competition have affected welfare schemes differently, with a policy gridlock in pension reforms, where voters of the {SVP} do not follow their elites, but unilateral retrenchment in unemployment insurance, where recipients can be portrayed as “underserving”.},

	abstract = {Developing countries may not have full-fledged welfare states like those we find in Europe, but certainly they have welfare state systems. For comparative social policy research the term "welfare state systems" has many advantages, as there are numerous different types/models of welfare state systems around the world. This path-breaking book, edited by Christian Aspalter, brings together leading experts to discuss social policy in 25 countries/regions around the world. From the most advanced welfare state systems in Scandinavia and Western Central Europe to the developing powers of Brazil, China, India, Russia, Mexico and Indonesia, each country-specific chapter provides a historical overview, discusses major characteristics of the welfare state system, analyzes country-specific problems, as well as critical current and future trends for further discussions, while also providing one additional major focal point/issue for greater in-depth analysis.  This book breaks new ground in ideal-typical welfare regime theory, identifying now in total 10 worlds of welfare capitalism. It provides broad perspectives on critical challenges which welfare state systems in the developing and developed world alike must address now and in the future. It will be of great interest to all scholars and students of social policy, social development, development and health economists, public policy, health policy, sociology, social work and social policy makers and administrators. This book is a reference book for researchers and social policy administrators; it can also serve as a textbook for courses on comparative social policy, international social policy and international social development.},

En combinant analyse de réseau et analyse des correspondances multiples des dirigeants des 110 plus grandes entreprises helvétiques en 1980, 2000 et 2010, nous mettons en évidence ces transformations, en montrant notamment le fort déclin des réseaux d’interconnexions entre conseils d’administration, la redéfinition des rapports à l’État ainsi que la modification des curricula de formation et des carrières des élites. Cette reconfiguration de l’élite du pouvoir traditionnelle est révélatrice de la remise en cause du cadre national dans l’organisation et les processus de légitimation des élites économiques suisses.},

In 1978 Switzerland was one of the richest countries in the world with a Gross National Product ({GNP}) of \$13,853 per capita. Between 1975 and 1978 it raised the proportion of exports of goods and services in its Gross Domestic Product ({GDP}) from 36 to 44 percent. In 1977 its current account surplus surpassed that of West Germany and was second only to Japan's. Between 1970 and the end of 1979 the Swiss Franc appreciated by about 90 percent on a trade-weighted basis; against the dollar the appreciation was about 120 percent. From a rate of more than 10 percent in 1974 its inflation rate dropped to 1 percent in 1978. Switzerland's official unemployment figures (which do not record the loss of more than 300,000 jobs among foreign workers and women since 1973) are lower than those of all other advanced industrial states. And even though since 1970 government expenditures have increased faster than in any other {OECD} country, Switzerland's budget deficit was cut by one-third in the midst of a general recession in 1976–1977. Real {GDP} dropped by more than 7 percent in 1975, which represented one of the largest declines in the {OECD} and was a much greater drop than had been recorded in any one year in the 1930s; yet, only two years later, in 1977 Switzerland's real {GNP} increased by 4.3 percent, which exceeded the growth rate of any other {OECD} member state.},

On the basis of density (and other general characteristics) of the networks we distinguish three main phases in their developments: a period of emergence (1910s-1930s), a period of consolidation (1950s-1980s) and a period of decline (1980s-2010s). We explain the developments by the notion of governance regimes at three levels: the legal framework, national business systems, and dominant ideology.},

	abstract = {Recent contributions in comparative political economy have made much of the 'growth model perspective', presenting it as a way to 'rethink political economy'. This paper argues that the origins of the growth model approach can be found in contributions by Michel Freyssenet made in the framework of {GERPISA} (Groupe d'étude et de recherche permanent sur l'industrie et les salariés de l'automobile) in the 1990s/2000. By presenting the contributions and limitations of Freyssenet's approach, it is possible to establish how contemporary growth model approaches fail to establish a solid link between political economy and heterodox macroeconomics. It appears that an approach that starts from the differentiation of interests of social groups and takes into account the autonomy of politics has more potential to achieve this task, allowing to recover the inspiration of Kalecki's 1943 article on the political limits to economic policy.},

L'approche choisie par Stefano Palombarini se veut ici résolument pluridisciplinaire. En combinant étude réalisée en termes de sous-systèmes et interrogation sur la spécificité du politique, l'auteur s'emploie à dépasser l'analyse classique, monodisciplinaire, jusqu'alors incapable de prévoir et d'expliquer la crise ouverte de 1992. Comment ignorer en effet l'interaction des sphères de la politique économique, de l'évolution macroéconomique et du soutien électoral pour appréhender une telle situation ? Comment en déchiffrer les mécanismes et les implications ? Le modèle théorique et les scénarios présentés dans ce texte viennent précisément souligner le rôle qu'ont pu jouer à la fois les politiques de court terme et l'exclusion des salariés de la base électorale du gouvernement dans la dynamique italienne. Ainsi, la crise est-elle analysée comme le résultat de l'épuisement endogène des marges de médiation politique entre les différents intérêts que la politique économique rendait initialement compatibles.},

The article explains this high capacity of adjustment by focusing on three major cases: the reform of competition policy, the liberalization of the telecom sector and the reforms of the public procurement policy. By examining the interactions between changes at the international level, the induced changing power relations and actor strategies at the domestic level, as well as national institutional constraints, we provide an empirical analysis of these reform processes. The article shows that domestic adjustment followed to a large extent similar patterns in all cases: the government and some administrative actors played an exceptionally strong leading role in formulating the content of the reforms and in shaping the policy processes. Further, we identify unusually exclusive decision- making processes, in which the opponents to the reforms were marginalized. Nevertheless, some strategic concessions were thereafter made to the "losers' of the reforms, in order to overcome the veto-point of the optional referendum which might have threatened their success.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Based on data from a Swiss survey study (N = 769), this research investigated individual-level determinants of trust in political authorities from a social psychological perspective. The study demonstrates that individuals with a low level of education who feel materially at risk and politically powerlessness expressed the lowest levels of political trust. This relationship was explained with differential endorsement of normative beliefs. A mediation analysis reveals that normative perceptions of Swiss society as being threatened by immorality and growing social inequalities accounted for the effect of perceived material risk on political distrust. The rejection of a duty-based citizenship norm (voting), in turn, mediated the impact of political powerlessness on distrust. Political orientation was unrelated to political trust. These findings illustrate the cognitive underpinnings of political alienation and suggest that perceived lack of political agency and perceived risk of social declassification are key factors in understanding political distrust.},

	abstract = {It is a notable irony that as democracy replaces other forms of governing throughout the world, citizens of the most established and prosperous democracies (the United States and Canada, Western European nations, and Japan) increasingly report dissatisfaction and frustration with their governments. Here, some of the most influential political scientists at work today examine why this is so in a volume unique in both its publication of original data and its conclusion that low public confidence in democratic leaders and institutions is a function of actual performance, changing expectations, and the role of information.  The culmination of research projects directed by Robert Putnam through the Trilateral Commission and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, these papers present new data that allow more direct comparisons across national borders and more detailed pictures of trends within countries than previously possible. They show that citizen disaffection in the Trilateral democracies is not the result of frayed social fabric, economic insecurity, the end of the Cold War, or public cynicism. Rather, the contributors conclude, the trouble lies with governments and politics themselves. The sources of the problem include governments' diminished capacity to act in an interdependent world and a decline in institutional performance, in combination with new public expectations and uses of information that have altered the criteria by which people judge their governments.  Although the authors diverge in approach, ideological affinity, and interpretation, they adhere to a unified framework and confine themselves to the last quarter of the twentieth century. This focus--together with the wealth of original research results and the uniform strength of the individual chapters--sets the volume above other efforts to address the important and increasingly international question of public dissatisfaction with democratic governance. This book will have obvious appeal for a broad audience of political scientists, politicians, policy wonks, and that still sizable group of politically minded citizens on both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific.},

However, as a result of insufficient domestic resources to fund the “development projects”, required for the economic progress, most of the countries strongly rely on internal (domestic) and external (international) capitals such as public debt, foreign direct investment ({FDI}) and remittances. Keeping in mind this significance, this study analyzes the role of public debt, {FDI} and remittances in accelerating the economic growth in Switzerland. For getting this purpose achieved, the study gathers the data from world development indicators ({WDI}) for the period of 1997-2016. The study uses public debt, {FDI} and remittances as predictors, while economic growth is taken as outcome variable. The study applies auto regressive distributive lag ({ARDL}) model to analyze the data. Results of the study show positive influence of public debt, {FDI} and remittances on the economic growth of Switzerland which is in line with the economic theory. Based on the findings, the study suggests articulating and implementing policies aimed at attracting more inflows of foreign capital that will positively contribute to economic growth in the long run. The study furthers the government of Switzerland to keep debts to the {GDP} threshold as low as possible.},

	shorttitle = {Collective Bargaining between Decentralization and Stability},
	abstract = {At the beginning of the 1990s, the abrupt change in economic conditions, characterized by a sharp rise of unemployment and the decline of traditional manufacturing industries, triggered a wide debate on collective bargaining in Switzerland. Employers' associations have actively sought the decentralization of the provisions contained in sectoral agreements. Although collective bargaining coverage has decreased only slightly, the functioning of Swiss industrial relations has been seriously challenged on various grounds during the 1990s. In important economic sectors, bargaining over key issues such as wages and working time has been transferred from the sectoral to the company level. Yet the general trend of decentralization and deregulation has affected the existing collective agreements in a highly uneven way. The in-depth changes in some industries constrast with the stability of bargaining in others. The scope of the present article is thus to illuminate both the general trend and the striking inter-sectoral differences within this trend. In a first step, we present empirical evidence on decentralization of sectoral collective bargaining. In a second step, we show nuances within this trend by developing an analytical framework that accounts for the pattern of change which collective bargaining has undergone in different economic sectors. Die brüske konjunkturelle Abkühlung anfangs der 90er Jahre und der mit ihr einhergehende, ungewohnt kräftige Anstieg in den Arbeitslosenzahlen löste in der Schweiz eine hitzige Debatte über das System der kollektiven Verhandlungen aus. Arbeitgeberverbände forderten lautstark eine Flexibilisierung und Dezentralisierung der Branchenabkommen. Obwohl der Deckungsgrad mit Gesamtarbeitsverträgen nur wenig abnahm, kam die schweizerische Sozialpartnerschaft unter erheblichen Druck während des letzten Jahrzehnts. In wichtigen Industriezweigen wurden kollektive Verhandlungen über die Löhne und die Arbeitszeit von der Branchenebene in die Unternehmen verlagert, der Teuerungsausgleich abgebaut und die Jahresarbeitszeit eingeführt. Der generelle Trend in Richtung Dezentralisierung und Deregulierung hat sich jedoch sehr unterschiedlich auf die verschiedenen Wirtschaftszweige ausgewirkt. Während in einigen Branchen die Verhandlungslogik grundlegend verändert wurde, herrschte in anderen Branchen Stabilität vor. Das Ziel des vorliegenden Artikels ist es deshalb, einerseits den allgemeinen Dezentralisierungstrend empirisch zu unterlegen und andererseits die erstaunlichen Branchenunterschiede innerhalb desselben Trends durch ein strukturelles Modell zu erklären.},

Sur la base de tous les actes votés par le Conseil national - issus des initiatives populaires ou soumis au référendum obligatoire et facultatif - depuis 1947, ils examinent d'abord l'évolution du recours aux instruments de démocratie directe. Ils étudient ensuite le lien entre le consensus au sein de l'élite et le sort des objets dans la phase plébiscitaire (soumis au vote ou non, accepté ou non). L'analyse amène les auteurs à réfuter la thèse du déclin du soutien aux autorités et à contester le bien-fondé de certaines mesures de réduction des droits populaires.

This article empirically examines the motives of workers for supporting a right-wing populist party. Based on data from the European Social Survey for Austria, Belgium, France, Norway, and Switzerland, three different sets of explanations are tested: (1) hypotheses stressing economic determinants, that is, the fear of wage pressure and competition over welfare benefits; (2) hypotheses emphasizing cultural determinants, that is, the perception of immigration as a threat to national identity; and (3) hypotheses focusing on social alienation, that is, dissatisfaction with the way the country's democracy works and the nonintegration into intermediary networks (trade unions). We find questions of community and identity to be clearly more important than economic grievances. Hence, in Austria and Switzerland, the electoral success of right-wing populist parties among workers seems primarily due to cultural protectionism: the defense of national identity against outsiders. In Belgium, France, and Norway, cultural protectionism is complemented by deep-seated discontent with the way the countries' democracies work.},

	abstract = {In the 1990s, sociologists engaged in a heated controversy about class voting. Although empirical evidence accumulated, positions remained surprisingly divided. This paper argues that this disagreement is due to two factors. Firstly, it reflects diverging understandings as to the concept of class voting. Secondly, it is explained by the use of class models that do not satisfactorily represent today's social stratification in Western Europe. In consequence, this paper uses a detailed multi-class schema and examines two cleavages running through the social structure: (i) the economic divide separating holders of organizational power from the workingclass, (ii) the cultural divide opposing high-skilled classes engaged in interpersonal work settings (who hold a liberation view of community) from low-skilled classes occupied in object-related tasks (who hold an authoritarian view of community). Based on individual level data, our analyses show that classes continue to systematically differ in their party support. There is strong electoral evidence for the traditional economic cleavage in Britain's and Germany's class structure, while in Switzerland the cultural cleavage seems more salient. Hence, class voting continues but appears to involve more (and different) class-party alliances than just leftvoting by the woking class. Among others, we find salaried professionals in the social and cultural services to rally the libertarian left, while managers support parties on the right. Moreover, where a right-wing populist party alternative exists, it attracts disproportionate support from production workers and small business owners.},

This has presented something of a dilemma to the traditional parties, and helps account for the decline of social-class voting. Scott Flanagan takes issue with Inglehart's interpretation in several particulars. Although their views converge in many respects, Flanagan urges conceptual reorientations and adumbrates a different interpretation of post–World War {II} political development in Europe and Japan.},

And, indeed, many authors, some of whom contributing to the present volume, mainly perceive a decline of cleavages, or at best a stabilization of old cleavages, but hardly anything new. However, new cleavages may be hard to find, because we look in the wrong places for their structural basis: it might just be that their value/normative element is contributing crucially to the structural closure of the groups involved – as it did in the case of religion previously. If we take such a possibility into account, several of the contributions to the present volume provide evidence for the emergence of a new value-based cleavage, which has mainly, albeit not exclusively, been driven by the challengers of the New Left and the new populist right.},

This study examines the transformation of party political systems in six countries (Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the {UK}) using opinion surveys, as well as newly collected data on election campaigns. The authors argue that, as a result of structural transformations and the strategic repositioning of political parties, Europe has observed the emergence of a tripolar configuration of political power, comprising the left, the moderate right, and the new populist right. They suggest that, through an emphasis on cultural issues such as mass immigration and resistance to European integration, the traditional focus of political debate - the economy - has been downplayed or reinterpreted in terms of this new political cleavage. This new analysis of Western European politics will interest all students of European politics and political sociology.},

This article starts from the assumption that the current process of globalization or denationalization leads to the formation of a new structural conflict in Western European countries, opposing those who benefit from this process against those who tend to lose in the course of the events. The structural opposition between globalization ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ is expected to constitute potentials for political mobilization within national political contexts, the mobilization of which is expected to give rise to two intimately related dynamics: the transformation of the basic structure of the national political space and the strategic repositioning of the political parties within the transforming space. The article presents several hypotheses with regard to these two dynamics and tests them empirically on the basis of new data concerning the supply side of electoral politics from six Western European countries (Austria, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland). The results indicate that in all the countries, the new cleavage has become embedded into existing two-dimensional national political spaces, that the meaning of the original dimensions has been transformed, and that the configuration of the main parties has become triangular even in a country like France.},

Our results show that, next to socio-demographic characteristics, subjective measurements have a considerable additional power in explaining the divide among Europeans along the communitarian–cosmopolitan dimension. Subjective deprivation, evaluation of globalization as a threat, and (sub)national and supranational identities play an important role in dividing Europeans into groups of winners and losers of globalization in both Western and Central and Eastern European countries. At the country level, the national degree of globalization is associated positively with the communitarian pole and negatively with the cosmopolitan pole in all {EU} countries.},

Although a lot is known about the socio-structural basis and the political organisation of this cleavage, we do not know the extent to which these political divides have led to social divides. Therefore, this article investigates how losers and winners of globalisation oppose each other. On the basis of representative online experiments in Germany and Austria, this article studies attitudes and behaviour towards people with different nationalities, education, and party preferences, which correspond to the cultural, socio-structural, and organisational elements of the new cleavage. More particularly, the extent to which people are willing to interact with each other in daily life and how much they trust each other is investigated. The main results show that people who identify with different parties (especially if they belong to the other side of the cleavage) oppose each other much more strongly than people with different nationalities. There is no divide, however, between the low-skilled and high-skilled. Finally, it appears that the social divides are asymmetrical: the winners of globalisation resent the losers more than the other way round.},

He has linked it to the increasing erosion of the representative function of European party systems. The spectre that haunted him was ‘partyless democracy’, a democratic regime where parties had lost their representative function, which opened the door for unmediated populist protest. While largely sharing his interpretation of the overall structural trends giving rise to the populist challenges in Western Europe, the article is critical of the static character of his assessment. It suggests that there are three forms of ‘protest populism’, all of which may eventually end up transforming the West European party systems in the name of the new structuring conflicts that characterise contemporary European societies. In addition, it proposes to extend the scope of Peter’s argument to the less established democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.},

This article uses quantitative text analysis to investigate how voters describe their ingroups and outgroups in open-ended survey responses. I look at Switzerland, a paradigmatic case of electoral realignment along a “second,” universalism–particularism dimension of politics opposing the far right and the new left. Keyness statistics and a semi-supervised document scaling method (latent semantic scaling) serve to identify terms associated with the poles of this divide in voters’ responses, and hence to measure universalist/particularist identities. Based on voters’ own words, the results support the idea of collective identities consolidating an emerging cleavage: Voters’ identity descriptions relate to far right versus new left support, along with known sociostructural and attitudinal correlates of the universalism–particularism divide, and they reveal how groups opposed on this dimension antagonistically demarcate themselves from each other.},

They demonstrate that the shift from authoritarian to libertarian values is related to (a) growing levels of social and political alienation along a number of key attitudinal dimensions; (b) a dramatic shift in positions on the key culture wars issues; and (c) higher participatory levels and more assertive modes of political involvement, yielding asymmetric mobilization around the culture wars issues.

Unfortunately, this type of data typically generates a number of statistical problems, of which clustering is particularly important. To exploit the opportunities offered by multilevel data, and to solve the statistical problems inherent in them, special statistical techniques are required. In this article, we focus on a technique that has become popular in educational statistics and sociology-multilevel analysis. In multilevel analysis, researchers build models that capture the layered structure of multilevel data, and determine how layers interact and impact a dependent variable of interest. Our objective in this article is to introduce the logic and statistical theory behind multilevel models, to illustrate how such models can be applied fruitfully in political science, and to call attention to some of the pitfalls in multilevel analysis.},

Covariance models that ignored the multilevel structure were then fit to the data. Results indicated that when variables exhibit minimal levels of intraclass correlation, the chi-square model/data fit statistic, the parameter estimators, and the standard error estimators are relatively unbiased. However, as the level of intraclass correlation increases, the chi-square statistic, the parameters, and their standard errors all exhibit estimation problems. The specific group/member configurations as well as the underlying between-group and within-group model structures further exacerbate the estimation problems encountered in the nonhierarchical analysis of multilevel data.},

	abstract = {Depuis 1977,  une enquête  est réalisée en Suisse après  toutes les votations fédérales, offrant un éclairage sur le vote des citoyennes et des citoyens. Jusqu’en juin 2016, ces sondages étaient réalisés sous le nom de {VOX}. A partir des votations de l’automne 2016, ce sont les enquêtes {VOTO} qui ont pris le relais et sont également intégrés dans {VoxIt}.

Les enquêtes post-votations standardisées sont issues d'un projet d'harmonisation des sondages Vox. En effet, la longue histoire de ces sondages fait que ceux-ci ont relativement changés au cours du temps, si bien qu'un gros travail de standardisation était nécessaire pour qu'une comparaison impliquant deux Vox très éloignées soit possible. Les données des 14 premiers sondages n'étant plus lisibles par les logiciels actuels, les enquêtes standardisées commencent avec le sondage Vox no. 15 portant sur la votation du 14.06.1981 et comprennent entre 2 et 4 enquêtes par année, suivant le nombre de votations.
 
Les données standardisées réunissent dans un même fichier des informations provenant de plusieurs sources. Tout d'abord, elles intègrent en les harmonisant les variables les plus importantes des sondages Vox.  A ce premier type de variables sont ajoutées certaines caractéristiques des votations et des objets (c'est-à-dire initiatives populaires ou référendums) relevés sur le site officiel de la Confédération: il s'agit notamment de données concernant la date de la votation, les résultats réalisés par chaque objet, le taux de participation et les mots d'ordre du Conseil fédéral. Les mots d'ordre des principaux partis politiques sont également intégrés, et ceci d'après des informations fournies par une base de données de l'Institut de science politique de l'Université de Berne. Finalement, les fichiers des enquêtes standardisées comportent un dernier type de variables, construites spécifiquement dans le but de synthétiser certaines données et/ou de permettre des comparaisons sur toute l'étendue des enquêtes disponibles.

Dans le cadre des enquêtes standardisées, l'ensemble des données liées à une votation fédérale (c'est-à-dire, à un week-end de votation) est appelé "scrutin". Le terme "projet", quant à lui, désigne un sous-ensemble de ces données, organisé par rapport à un objet particulier (initiative, référendum, etc.) de cette votation. Concrètement, les enquêtes Vox standardisées proposent donc, pour chaque votation, les données sous deux formes: d'une part sous celle d'un fichier scrutin consacré à la votation dans son ensemble, d'autre part sous la forme d'un fichier séparé de type projet pour chaque objet soumis à votation. Des fichiers cumulant tous les scrutins et tous les projets existent également. Le choix de l'une ou de l'autre forme de fichiers dépend évidemment des analyses que l'on souhaite effectuer. 

Toute une série d'informations complémentaires sur le projet Voxit et les données standardisées sont disponibles sur le site http://forscenter.ch/fr/service-de-donnees-et-d-information-sur-la-recherche/service-donnees/projets-speciaux-ccs-pow-pisa-tree-vox-voxit/vox-voxit/ où l'on trouvera également les indications concernant l'accès aux fichiers cumulés.},

	abstract = {Repeated cross-sectional ({RCS}) designs are distinguishable from true panels and pooled cross-sectional time series ({PCSTS}) since cross-sectional units (e.g., individual survey respondents) appear but once in the data. This poses two serious challenges. First, as with {PCSTS}, autocorrelation threatens inferences. However, common solutions like differencing and using a lagged dependent variable are not possible with {RCS} since lags for i cannot be used. Second, although {RCS} designs contain information that allows both aggregate- and individual-level analyses, available methods—from pooled ordinary least squares to {PCSTS} to time series—force researchers to choose one level of analysis. The {PCSTS} tool kit does not provide an appropriate solution, and we offer one here: double filtering with {ARFIMA} methods to account for autocorrelation in longer {RCS} followed by the use of multilevel modeling to estimate both aggregate- and individual-level parameters simultaneously. We use Monte Carlo experiments and three applied examples to explore the advantages of our framework.},

	abstract = {During the 1990s, the working class has become the core clientele of right-wing populist parties in Western Europe. This article empirically examines the motives of workers for supporting a rightwing populist party. Based on data from the European Social Survey for Austria, Belgium, France, Norway, and Switzerland, three different sets of explanations are tested: (1) hypotheses stressing economic determinants, that is, the fear of wage pressure and competition over welfare beneﬁts; (2) hypotheses emphasizing cultural determinants, that is, the perception of immigration as a threat to national identity; and (3) hypotheses focusing on social alienation, that is, dissatisfaction with the way the country’s democracy works and the nonintegration into intermediary networks (trade unions). We ﬁnd questions of community and identity to be clearly more important than economic grievances. Hence, in Austria and Switzerland, the electoral success of right-wing populist parties among workers seems primarily due to cultural protectionism: the defense of national identity against outsiders. In Belgium, France, and Norway, cultural protectionism is complemented by deep-seated discontent with the way the countries’ democracies work.},

The existence of a large right-wing party with strong support among the working class contributes to blurring the traditional class divisions in voting. However, the analysis indicates that class cleavage has not completely disappeared. The centre-right parties display much continuity in their class basis over time, thus contributing to the persistence of class cleavage. Besides taking into account the diversity of the right-wing parties, the article also offers a new perspective by including nonvoting. Class differences in turnout are important in Switzerland, but the findings suggest that the most important change over time concerns party choice and not turnout.},

Un monde sépare la Suisse que nous imaginons et celle qui existe vraiment. En 1992, dans le cadre du Pavillon suisse de l’Exposition universelle à Séville, l’artiste Ben Vautier avait déclenché une polémique avec son tableau sur lequel on pouvait lire que, selon lui, « La Suisse n’existe pas ». Or aujourd’hui la question qui se pose n’est pas tant de savoir si la Suisse existe, car indubitablement oui : elle existe ! Mais cette Suisse, qui existe, est-elle vraiment celle que nous pensons chérir et aimons raconter aux autres ? C’est ici qu’un doute s’installe. Car entre nos mythes et la réalité, un véritable fossé s’est creusé. Cet ouvrage a pour but de mieux comprendre pourquoi la Suisse est dans une impasse et comment nous pouvons contribuer, à notre échelle, à en sortir.},

	abstract = {Mixture modeling is a widely applied data analysis technique used to identify unobserved heterogeneity in a population. Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion ({ICs}) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis ({LCA}), a factor mixture model ({FMA}), and a growth mixture models ({GMM}). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the {ICs}, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.},

	shorttitle = {Latent Class Modeling with Covariates},
	abstract = {Researchers using latent class ({LC}) analysis often proceed using the following three steps: (1) an {LC} model is built for a set of response variables, (2) subjects are assigned to {LCs} based on their posterior class membership probabilities, and (3) the association between the assigned class membership and external variables is investigated using simple cross-tabulations or multinomial logistic regression analysis. Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004) demonstrated that such a three-step approach underestimates the associations between covariates and class membership. They proposed resolving this problem by means of a specific correction method that involves modifying the third step. In this article, I extend the correction method of Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars by showing that it involves maximizing a weighted log-likelihood function for clustered data. This conceptualization makes it possible to apply the method not only with categorical but also with continuous explanatory variables, to obtain correct tests using complex sampling variance estimation methods, and to implement it in standard software for logistic regression analysis. In addition, a new maximum likelihood ({ML})—based correction method is proposed, which is more direct in the sense that it does not require analyzing weighted data. This new three-step {ML} method can be easily implemented in software for {LC} analysis. The reported simulation study shows that both correction methods perform very well in the sense that their parameter estimates and their {SEs} can be trusted, except for situations with very poorly separated classes. The main advantage of the {ML} method compared with the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars approach is that it is much more efficient and almost as efficient as one-step {ML} estimation.},

They suggest that through an emphasis on cultural issues such as mass immigration and resistance against European integration, the traditional focus of political debate - the economy - has been downplayed or reinterpreted in terms of this new political cleavage.},

This article identifies a similar trend in Switzerland and argues that three destabilizing factors account for it: 1) retrenchment pressure and ideological polarization prevent compromises; 2) the emergence of new social demands and interests challenges the homogeneity and legitimacy of peak organizations and thus their bargaining power; 3) increasing media coverage tends to open up the traditionally confidential and selective sphere of corporatist negotiation and weakens the social partners’ ability to reach agreements. The impact of these factors on neo-corporatist bargaining is tested in Switzerland, a case where corporatist negotiations used to be particularly decisive in social policy making. Empirical evidence comes from a cross-time comparison of two major social policies: Unemployment insurance and pension reforms in the 1970s and in the 1990s. In the last decade, the main locus of decision-making shifted from the sphere of interest groups to partisan politics. In parliament, the political parties were able to draft bills enjoying wide acceptance thanks to compensations offered to groups particularly vulnerable to new social risks.},

The article explains this high capacity of adjustment by focusing on three major cases: the reform of competition policy, the liberalization of the telecom sector and the reforms of the public procurement policy. By examining the interactions between changes at the international level, the induced changing power relations and actor strategies at the domestic level, as well as national institutional constraints, we provide an empirical analysis of these reform processes. The article shows that domestic adjustment followed to a large extent similar patterns in all cases: the government and some administrative actors played an exceptionally strong leading role in formulating the content of the reforms and in shaping the policy processes. Further, we identify unusually exclusive decision- making processes, in which the opponents to the reforms were marginalized. Nevertheless, some strategic concessions were thereafter made to the "losers' of the reforms, in order to overcome the veto-point of the optional referendum which might have threatened their success.},

It focuses on three types of power resources: positions in the university hierarchy, scientific reputation and extra-academic positions in the economic and political spheres. Based on a biographical database of N = 487 professors, it examines how these resources developed from 1957 to 2000. We find that professors of economic sciences were increasingly and simultaneously successful on all three studied dimensions – especially when compared to disciplines such as law, social sciences or humanities. This evolution seems to challenge the notorious trade-off between scientific and society poles of the academic field: professors of economics and business increased their scientific reputation while becoming more powerful in worldly positions. However, zooming in on their individual endowment with capital, we see that the same professors rarely hold simultaneously a significant amount of scientific and institutional capital., Cet article étudie l’affirmation des professeurs d’économie politique et de gestion d’entreprise durant la seconde moitié du xxe siècle en Suisse. Il se centre sur trois types de ressources de pouvoir : positions dans la hiérarchie universitaire, réputation scientifique et positions extra-académiques dans les sphères économique et politique. A partir de données biographiques au sujet de N = 487 professeurs, il examine comment ces ressources se sont développées entre 1957 et 2000. Nos résultats montrent que les professeurs de sciences économiques ont de plus en plus de succès dans les trois dimensions étudiées – spécialement si on les compare à d’autres disciplines comme le droit ou les sciences humaines et sociales. Cette évolution semble infirmer la soi-disant incompatibilité entre le pôle scientifique et le pôle mondain du champ académique : en effet les professeurs d’économie et de gestion augmentent leur réputation scientifique tout en occupant de plus en plus de positions exécutives au sein et en dehors de l’académie. Cependant, si l’on se penche sur la dotation individuelle en capital, nous voyons que ce sont rarement les mêmes professeurs qui détiennent de manière simultanée un volume important de capital scientifique et institutionnel., In diesem Artikel untersuchen wir den Aufstieg der Professoren der Volks- und Betriebswirtschaft in der Schweiz der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts. Wir konzentrieren uns auf drei Arten von Machtressourcen: Positionen in der Universitätshierarchie, wissenschaftlicher Ruf und ausserakademische Positionen in Wirtschaft und Politik. Basierend auf einer biographischen Datenbank von 487 Professoren, untersuchen wir wie sich diese Machtressourcen zwischen 1957 und 2000 entwickeln. Unsere Resultate zeigen, dass wirtschafswissenschaftliche Professoren bezüglich aller drei Machtdimensionen gleichzeitig erfolgreich sind – insbesondere im Vergleich mit den Rechts- sozial oder Geisteswissenschaften. Diese Entwicklung scheint der notorischen Unvereinbarkeit der Akkumulation von wissenschaftlichen und ausserakademischen Machtressourcen zu widersprechen: Wirtschaftsprofessoren erhöhen ihre wissenschaftliche Reputation und ihre ausseruniversitäre Macht gleichzeitig. Ein Blick auf die individuelle Ausstattung mit Machtressourcen zeigt allerdings, dass nur selten dieselben Professoren gleichzeitig wissenschaftliches und institutionelles Kapital besitzen.},

And can the variations between such cantonal welfare regimes be explained by the same politico-institutional variables that account for the development of national welfare states? These are the guiding questions of this article. We find strong empirical evidence for large inter-cantonal variation in welfare state policies. The sub-regimes are not functionally connected, however. Their variation is related to different sets of variables, indicating a weak functional link between them. Developments and causal structures are specific to the various subregimes. In addition, it is socio-economic and not politicoinstitutional variables that have had the strongest imprint on the overall structure of cantonal welfare regimes.},

La question de la représentativité sociale des partis sociaux-démocrates n’est pourtant pas nouvelle et a depuis longtemps été pensée dans un cadre transnational, les acteurs partisans comparant les situations nationales et/ou s’inspirant de pratiques et d’idées des « partis frères ». L’impression même d’homogénéité passée des électorats sociaux-démocrates est à questionner au regard des mobilisations souvent interclassistes de ces partis, des transformations fines des mondes ouvriers et populaires depuis le {XIXe} siècle, et des migrations qui ont constamment interrogé le cadre d’action national des social-démocraties. Cet article prend le cas du Parti socialiste suisse pour analyser les schèmes d’appréhension de l’électorat et les stratégies de mobilisation développés par les cadres et activistes partisans. Si l’après-guerre marque l’intégration du parti dans les accords de partage du pouvoir sur la base de quotes-parts électorales supposément stables, le parti s’est, en coulisses, constamment interrogé sur son ancrage social et son rapport aux mondes ouvriers. En pleine guerre froide, le parti a d’abord cherché à écarter le stigmate du « rouge » et à s’adresser aux « classes moyennes ». L’arrivée des femmes sur le marché électoral en 1971, mais aussi les tensions autour de la forte migration de travail dans les années 1960-1970 conduisent les sociaux-démocrates à repenser leur focalisation sur un électeur-type ouvrier, masculin et suisse.},

	abstract = {La Société suisse du Grutli était une importante association patriotique qui réunit à ses débuts des compagnons artisans, puis attira de plus en plus d'ouvriers. Phénomène sans équivalent à l'étranger, elle influença le mouvement ouvrier suisse du {XIXe} s. en jouant un rôle d'intégration sociale et d'unification nationale. Elle fut fondée à Genève en 1838 sous la forme d'un cercle politique. Elle doit son nom à Johannes Niederer, qui pensait que "quelque chose de grandiose pourrait naître un jour de cette association de Suisses sans distinction d'origines cantonales, à l'image de la Suisse née au Grütli", et son programme à Albert Galeer (Der moralische Volksbund und die freie Männerschule oder der Grütliverein, 1846). S'inspirant de l'association ouvrière allemande de Genève (Associations ouvrières allemandes), Galeer mit sur pied une infrastructure caractéristique, attrayante pour les compagnons faisant leur tour de Suisse (locaux, bibliothèques, journaux et cours). Prenant pour devise "par l'instruction à la liberté", la Société proposait une formation apte à rendre indépendants les maîtres artisans et les citoyens. Ses activités (chant, gymnastique, tir, théâtre) et ses fêtes étaient imprégnées d'une dimension patriotique. Son organisation interne parfaitement démocratique compensait les frustrations de compagnons qui n'avaient pas facilement accès à la vie politique de la cité; par des institutions comme le soutien financier lors de déplacements, l'aide en cas de maladie et les caisses d'épargne de section, elle palliait certains désavantages sociaux. Elle servait ainsi de seconde patrie pour ses membres en voyage. Les multiples services qu'elle offrait lui valut une stabilité étonnante, par comparaison avec les autres organisations ouvrières du {XIXe} s.

Cela s'avère particulièrement vrai en matière de gouvernement d'entreprise, notamment en ce qui concerne le droit des sociétés, la surveillance des marchés boursiers ou le droit comptable. En raison du caractère très général de la législation, divers mécanismes de gouvernance privée ont généralement complété la base légale minimale dans ces trois domaines. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, on assiste cependant à une profonde transformation de ces mécanismes d'autorégulation dans le sens d'une formalisation accrue et d'un remplacement progressif des solutions privées par des réglementations publiques plus précises dans cinq domaines cruciaux: transférabilité des actions, droit de vote des actions en dépôt auprès des banques, offres publiques d'achat, surveillance des marchés boursiers et établissement des normes comptables. Sous l'effet des transformations de l'environnement international, de l'évolution des préférences de certains acteurs économiques importants et de l'affirmation de nouveaux acteurs (investisseurs institutionnels et experts-comptables notamment), le cadre réglementaire du gouvernement d'entreprise suisse a été réformé en profondeur.},

This apparent contradiction is often explained by emphasizing the trade-off between extensive job security regulations and generous unemployment insurance benefits. This explanation, however, is not convincing for the Swiss case, as the coverage of the unemployment insurance system was very low until the late 1970s. This article argues that low levels of job security regulations are the result of the weakness of the federal state, which attempted several times to enact restrictive job security regulations. Each attempt to enact job security regulations, however, has been blocked by an alliance of liberal-conservative political groupings and employers’ associations. The present article traces the historical development of job security regulations in Switzerland and reveals the political coalitions that successfully kept the federal state weak.},

	abstract = {Communism has collapsed. Capitalism has rid itself of the competition on which it thrives. But though now victorious, capitalism has become a threat. The future of us all may be shaped by the outcome of the conflict between capitalism as victor and capitalism as threat. Not only in Europe, but also in the {US} and Japan - and no doubt shortly in the Eastern countries too - the great debate is capitalism versus capitalism. On the one hand is the "neo-American" model based on individual achievement and short-term profits. On the other is the Rhine model practices in Switzerland, Germany, Benelux, Northern Europe and, partly, in Japan. In the Rhine model collective achievement and public concensus are seen as the keys to long-term success.The first is more seductive, the second more effective. These two opposing forms of capitalism are engaged in a war which, like all internal conflicts, involves both secrecy and even hypocrisy. The outcome of this struggle could affect the quality of life on all levels of society.The author of this book aims to provide a synthesis which will force the reader to consider the political and economic issues at stake towards the end of the century.},

A re-analysis of Lijphart's (1999) study of the Swiss political system from 1997 to 2007 clearly demonstrates that due to recent political-institutional changes (a decreasing number of parties, growing electoral disproportionality, increasing decentralization and deregulation of the relationship between the state and interest groups), a consensus democracy with strong tendencies toward adjustment and normalization of the original exceptional Swiss case to meet the rest of the continental European consensus democracies has emerged. This development has been further strengthened by intensified public political contestation, rising polarization between the political camps in parliament, and the weakening of the cooperative search for consensus as the dominant mode of negotiation within the government. From the perspective of international comparison, Switzerland can thus be seen henceforth as a typical example, not an extreme case, of consensus democracy.},

By replicating Lijphart's analysis in the Swiss subnational context, the article seeks to explain the relationships of the political-institutional variables in the Swiss cantons. The main finding of the article is that in contrast to international comparisons, the cantons cannot be classified along the continuum of majoritarian and consensus democracies. However, the Swiss cantonal democracies practice clearly distinguishable forms of power sharing. Based on a factor analysis and a cluster analysis, it is possible to distinguish a two-dimensional pattern of cantonal democracies and five groups of cantons. Although there are a number of different procedures to achieve political stability through division of power in the cantons, the different characteristics of power sharing can, essentially – and with reference to Switzerland's central institutions – perfectly well be situated on a single axis; namely, on that between pronounced direct citizen involvement and broadly supported government coalitions.},

I successively take up the three aspects embraced by the notion of ‘cleavages’ – their structural base, the political values of the groups involved, and their political articulation. My main argument is that the decline of traditional cleavages does not necessarily signify the end of structuration of politics by social divisions. There is ample empirical evidence for the existence of a new social division between two segments of the new middle class, which has important consequences for politics. This new social division is shown to be closely linked to the new ‘value cleavage’ although it is not able to fully account for the enormous political implications which contrasting value-orientations have today. Finally, I suggest that the political articulation of both the transformed class structure and the new configuration of values is strongly shaped by the political legacy of traditional cleavages.},

This article analyzes the actors and ideologies that have triggered the emergence of a polarizing cultural antagonism, and shows that this conflict is not primarily about Switzerland's relationship with Europe. The implications of the emergence of the new cultural conflict for democracy are far from clear. Using an innovative approach to measure the congruence between voter preferences and party positions, I show that the representation of citizens’ interests along the cultural dimension has improved significantly since the 1970s. The concomitant polarization of the economic dimension has not altered the quality of representation, on the other hand. I conclude by discussing the trade-offs between the political articulation of a traditionalist-communitarian conception of community that clearly resonates with an important part of the Swiss populace, and other components of liberal democracy.},

	abstract = {Stein Rokkan’s comparative historical account of party system formation in Western Europe has proved enormously influential due to the appeal of tying individual political behaviour to large-scale historical transformations. This article reviews the literature that has studied the genesis of cleavage-based party systems, as well as theoretical and empirical assessments of the degree to which they have remained “frozen”. If it is adapted to allow for a more dynamic perspective, the cleavage approach also helps us to make sense of recent transformations of Western European party systems by pointing to new “critical junctures” that are likely to have a lasting impact on party competition and on individual political behaviour. 
In the second part of this review, I discuss applications of the approach outside Western Europe, focusing above all on Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. If it is modified according to the specific historical trajectories of these countries, the cleavage concept helps us understand both how party systems become institutionalized in new democracies, as well as the type of conflicts they are likely to reflect. Furthermore, criticisms of social structural determinism have resulted in a new generation of scholarship that insists in paying more attention to the interplay of structure and agency in forging long-term bonds between parties and voters.},

The years of interest are the last three decades of the twentieth century, when the broadly cherished Keynesian model was gradually replaced by a revived form of classical liberal economic thinking, i.e., neoliberalism. In order to measure the impact of these neoliberal values on social democratic parties, I use the widely utilized Manifesto Data Set and develop a new, exclusively socioeconomic, left–right scale that mainly focuses on core political questions regarding the scope of the state, the role of markets and the allocation of public goods. The results from the descriptive analysis reveal that neoliberal values did gain influence also within social democratic parties, although no more than four parties demonstrate a significant and long-standing ideological change towards the neoliberal pole. A less clear neoliberal trend, moreover, can be distinguished in five additional parties while the remaining ten parties within the West European social democratic party family did not experience any enduring ideological shifts.},

This transformation seems to be altering the basic value priorities of given generations as a result of changing conditions influencing their basic socialization’ (Inglehart 1971: 991). Survey evidence from six West European societies revealed large differences between the value priorities of older and younger generations. Among the older cohorts, ‘materialist’ values, emphasising economic and physical security, were overwhelmingly predominant – but as one moved from older to younger birth cohorts, ‘post-materialist’ values, emphasising autonomy and self-expression, became increasingly widespread. The differences were striking. Among those aged 65 or older, materialists were fully 12 times as numerous as post-materialists; among those born after World War {II} (who were under 25 in 1970), post-materialists were slightly more numerous than materialists.},

Out of a total of 190 years of government coalitions that can be analysed in this way in ten countries from 1919 to 1979, the socio-economic dimension predominated eight times as frequently as the religious dimension. The much greater salience of the socio-economic dimension is found in all ten countries without striking variations during the entire period.},

Building on the major earlier research achievements in comparative electoral behavior, this four-country multivariate analysis compares the indices of voting and the party choice "trees" on the basis of national sample surveys conducted in the 1970s. From this crucial contest among the three determinants of party choice, religion emerges as the victor, language as a strong runner-up, and class as a distant third. The surprising strength of the religious factor can be explained in terms of the "freezing" of past conflict dimensions in the party system and the presence of alternative, regional-federal, structures for the expression of linguistic interests.},

Cette étude examine l'évolution des identifications partisanes au cours des quatre dernières décennies en Suisse. Elle montre que la proportion de personnes qui se sentent proches d'un parti a pratiquement été divisée par deux entre 1971 et 1999, puis s'est maintenue à un niveau bas, autour de 30 \%. Alors que les personnes proches d’un parti donnent majoritairement leur voix à leur parti préféré, la décision électorale des personnes sans attachement partisan est plus hétérogène. En raison de leur nombre croissant, les personnes sans attachement partisan - celles qui ne se sentent proches d'aucun parti ou ne s’identifient à aucun parti - sont devenues plus importantes pour la force électorale des partis par rapport aux années 1970. En plus des partis non gouvernementaux, l'{UDC} (Union démocratique du centre) a obtenu des résultats supérieurs auprès des personnes sans attaches partisanes depuis 1999. Les personnes ne s’identifiant à aucun parti sont plus souvent de sexe féminin, plus jeunes, sans affiliation religieuse, sans diplôme universitaire et ont des revenus plus faibles. Politiquement, elles se distinguent par leur scepticisme à l'égard de l'{UE} et leur opposition à une augmentation des dépenses sociales.},

	abstract = {New forms of social stratification are emerging. Much of our thinking about stratification - from Marx, Weber, and others - must be recast to capture these new developments. Social class was the key theme of past stratification work. Yet class is an increasingly outmoded concept. Class stratification implies that people can be differentiated hierarchically on one or more criteria into distinct layers, classes. Class analysis has grown increasingly inadequate in recent decades as traditional hierarchies have declined and new social differences have emerged. The cumulative impact of these changes is fundamentally altering the nature of social stratification - placing past theories in need of substantial modification. This paper outlines first some general propositions about the sources of class stratification and its decline. The decline of hierarchy, and its spread across situses, is emphasised. The general propositions are applied to political parties and ideological cleavages, the economy, the family, and social mobility. These developments appear most clearly in North America and Western Europe, but our propositions also help interpret some of the tensions and factors driving change in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and other societies.},

	abstract = {Until the last quarter of the 20th Century, Western party systems appeared to be frozen and stability was generally taken to be the central characteristic of individual-level party choice. But during the 1970s and 1980s, in a spasm of change that appeared to occur in all countries, this ceased to be true. Voters in Western countries suddenly demonstrated an unexpected and increasing unpredictability in their choices between parties, often to the extent of voting for parties that are quite new to the political scene. Understanding these fundamental changes became a pressing concern for political scientists and commentators alike, and a matter of extensive controversy and debate. In the middle 1980s, an international team of leading scholars set out to explore the reasons for these shifts in voting patterns in sixteen western countries: all those of the (then) European Community (except for Luxembourg and Portugal), together with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United States. In this book they report their findings regarding the connections between social divisions and party choice, and the manner in which these links had changed since the mid-1960s. The authors based their country studies on a common research design. By doing so, they were able to focus on the characteristics that the sixteen countries had in common so as to evaluate the extent to which the changes had a common source. This is a longitudinal study, extending over nearly a generation, of changes in voting behaviour that is as fully cross-national as it was possible to produce at the time. Its findings enabled the authors to break away from conventional explanations for electoral change to arrive at conclusions of far-reaching importance. The passage of time has not dated this book, and in this edition the original text is augmented by a new Preface that describes the ways in which the book s findings retain their relevance for contemporary scholarship, and by an Epilogue in which the main analyses reported in the book are brought up to date to the middle 2000s.},
