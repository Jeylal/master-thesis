# Abstract {.unnumbered}

What are the relationships between political cleavages, the formation of social blocs and socio-economic characteristics such as income and education? The present master thesis analyzes the links between socio-economic factors, the formation of socio-political groups and social blocs in Switzerland. After assessing the country's political stability in the last decades, a long-run analysis of the socio-economic determinants of voting outcomes, political leaning and policy preferences are conducted. Finally, the results from a latent class analysis aimed at identifying the recomposition of the Swiss social blocs in the late 90s are presented. This master thesis is the first work to conduct such an analysis for Switzerland, and the aim of this essay is to provide a first step into a overall analysis of the political economy of institutional change in Switzerland in the last decades, from a neorealist perspective.
